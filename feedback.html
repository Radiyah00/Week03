<h1>Feedback Survey for Group 7</h1>
Positive Feedback:

The questions are clear and concise. 
The questions aren't biased.
There is a pretty good mix of open ended and close ended questions.
I understood that the survey aimed to figure out how the user feels when using the website.

Improve:
The survey asks "How confident are you when using the website?"
The question doesn't quite make sense, and can be taken off the survey. It could be rephrased as how much the users trust the website or the sellers on the website.
